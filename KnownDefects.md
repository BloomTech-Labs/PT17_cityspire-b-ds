### Bugs
- */api/get_data* endpoint if target city is not in DB, throws an error
- */api/weather_historical* endpoint may take longer to respond and can cause unresponsive web page

### Incomplete Features
- Livability score has to be re-calculated due to added new features: weather, housing prices, job listings, school data
